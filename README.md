## Bump

I plan for Bump to be a procedurally generated platforming music visualiser.
How the game would work is the player would spawn on top of a lane of moving,
colour changing cubes that constantly spawn and move towards the player before 
falling as the player passes them. This was inspired by the game ClusterTruck. The 
blocks will also bounce up and down as they move in time with the music playing 
through the game akin to many generic visualisers. The cubes would also come in
various randomly generated patterns and with randomly generated obstacles to keep
gameplay fast paced and exciting while also hopefully creating some gorgeous
visuals to keep things interesting.

For an art style I was thiking something along the lines of Beatsaber with darker colours
contrasted with bright primary coloured neon for that flashy club/EDM feeling.
